Personal Assistance Company
Overview
Vision: ‘In order to imagine the end result of this project, imagine a platform like Fiverr
reorganized to be entirely under the umbrella of a personal assistant; where a client’s
point-of-contact with our company (and service) is an administrative personal AI working
cooperatively with a human support team. Our personal assistance service enables clients to
request support for any task, and to do so in complete confidentiality. Unlike platforms such as
Fiverr, which require clients to define solutions to problems they face and/or identify individuals
to execute them, our service allows clients to simply ask for help, and our personal AI will
work with the client to determine potential courses of action, as well as collaborate with
our human team to implement a successful solution. This outcome will be fully guaranteed;
should the resolution not meet expectations, a full refund will be provided.’
Company Mission: To help and support people however we can, always putting the individual
first. Our world is full of people and companies putting themselves first at the cost of others, and
our mission is to be the counterpoint to that.
